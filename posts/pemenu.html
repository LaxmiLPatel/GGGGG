        <div class="blus">::1 | 1713482638666<br />My dietary restrictions are Vegan. My health issues are High bp.
            Foods available are Rice. What food should I order?</div>
        <div class="blgg">GEMINI | 1713482641617<br />You should order rice. Rice is a good source of carbohydrates and
            fiber, and it is low in fat and sodium. It is also a good source of several vitamins and minerals, including
            iron, magnesium, and selenium.

            Here are some tips for ordering rice at a restaurant:

            * Ask for brown rice instead of white rice. Brown rice is a whole grain and contains more fiber and
            nutrients than white rice.
            * Ask for your rice to be cooked without oil or butter.
            * Add your own healthy toppings to your rice, such as vegetables, beans, or lentils.

            Here is a sample vegan rice dish that you could order:

            * Brown rice with steamed vegetables and tofu</div><br />



        <div class="blus">::1 | 1713497809678<br />My dietary restrictions are Jain. My health issues are Diabetes.
            Foods available are Garlic, wheat bread, granola, hot dog. What food should I order?</div>
        <div class="blgg">GEMINI | 1713497812134<br />As per Jain dietary restrictions, you cannot consume garlic,
            onions, and root vegetables. Hot dogs typically contain meat, which is also not allowed in the Jain
            diet.

            Therefore, the only suitable option for you is **wheat bread** and **granola**. However, please note
            that granola may contain nuts or other ingredients that are not suitable for people with diabetes.

            It is important to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to ensure that you are
            meeting all of your nutritional needs while following a Jain diet and managing diabetes.</div><br />

        <div class="blgg">GEMINI | 1713584505400<br />As a vegetarian with chronic pancreatitis and psychosis, you
            should avoid foods that are high in fat and sugar, such as buttered popcorn, poutine, chicken parm, and
            parma ham. You should also avoid alcohol, which can worsen psychosis.

            Of the foods available, the best choices for you are champ (a type of vegetarian burger) and rendang (a
            spicy Indonesian curry dish). These dishes are both relatively low in fat and sugar, and they are both good
            sources of protein and fiber.

            Lobster is also a good choice, as it is a lean protein that is low in fat and sugar. However, you should
            avoid eating lobster if you are allergic to shellfish.</div><br />
